# Description & Notes
- Create a resource group module first and call it in main.tf
- Create a key vault module and call it main.tf
- Make sure to create access policy in key vault (because though you create key vault, unless you access it, you will not be able to write secrets to it)
- Create a module for cosmosdb and call it main.tf (make sure to write outputs as they may need to push into keyvault)
- Create a module for keyvault secret and call it in main.tf (make sure to push the cosmos db outputs as keyvault secrets )
